    <h2> Taj Mahal</h2>
    <div id="p1"> 
        The Taj Mahal, an immense mausoleum of white marble, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, is the jewel of Muslim art <br>in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage. It no doubt partially owes its renown to the moving circumstances of its construction.<br> Shah Jahan, in order to perpetuate the memory of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631, had this funerary mosque built. The monument, begun in 1632,<br> was finished in 1648; unverified but nonetheless, tenacious, legends attribute its construction to an international team of several thousands of masons, marble workers,<br> mosaicists and decorators working under the orders of the architect of the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahori.<br><br>

Situated on the right bank of the Yamuna in a vast Mogul garden of some 17 ha, this funerary monument, bounded by four isolated minarets, reigns with its octagonal<br> structure capped by a bulbous dome through the criss-cross of open perspectives offered by alleys or basins of water. The rigour of a perfect elevation of astonishing<br> graphic purity is disguised and almost contradicted by the scintillation of a fairy-like decor where the white marble, the main building material, brings out and scintillates<br> the floral arabesques, the decorative bands, and the calligraphic inscriptions which are incrusted in polychromatic pietra dura. The materials were brought in from all over<br> India and central Asia and white Makrana marble from Jodhpur. Precious stones for the inlay came from Baghdad, Punjab, Egypt, Russia, Golconda, China, Afghanistan,<br> Ceylon, Indian Ocean and Persia. The unique Mughal style combines elements and styles of Persian, Central Asian and Islamic architecture.

<h2>  Himanchal Pradesh</h2>
<div id="p2">
    Himachal Pradesh, state of India, in the extreme northern part of the Asian subcontinent. It is bounded by Jammu and Kashmir union territory to the northwest and Ladakh<br> union territory to the northeast, by the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the east, and by the states of Uttarakhand to the southeast, Haryana to the south, and Punjab to the west.<br> Himachal Pradesh occupies a region of scenic splendour in the western Himalayas, offering a multitextured display of lofty snow-clad mountains, deep gorges, thickly forested valleys,<br> large lakes, terraced fields, and cascading streams. Indeed, the name of the state is a reference to its setting: Himachal means “snowy slopes” (Sanskrit: hima, “snow”; acal, “slopes”),<br> and Pradesh means “state.”
<br><br>
    The history of this mountainous state is complex and fragmented. It is known that a number of so-called Aryan groups filtered into the more productive valleys during the Vedic<br> period (c. 1500 to 500 BCE) and assimilated the pre-Aryan population. Later, successive Indian empires—such as the Mauryan (c. 321–185 BCE), the Gupta (c. 320–540 CE),<br> and the Mughal (1526–1761), all emerging in the Indo-Gangetic Plain—sought to exercise varying degrees of control over trade and pilgrimage routes into the area and between India<br> and Tibet across the Himalayas.

The remote, predominantly Buddhist area that is now the district of Lahaul and Spiti was controlled by Ladakh from the decline of the Mughal Empire<br> (about the mid-18th century) until the early 1840s, when it briefly came under Sikh rule.<br><br> Also during this period, warring semiautonomous petty rulers controlled the trade routes, as well as desirable segments of agricultural and pastoral land, in the other areas of present-day<br> Himachal Pradesh. British domination of this region followed the Sikh Wars of the 1840s and continued, directly or indirectly, for the next 100 years.

Around the time of Indian independence<br> in 1947, there was a popular movement to end feudalism in the region, and the princely state of Suket virtually surrendered to peaceful demonstrators. Subsequently, Himachal Pradesh was<br> constituted as a province in 1948. It consisted of 30 princely states and was administered by a chief commissioner, who represented the government of India.

Between 1948 and its achievement<br> of statehood in 1971, Himachal Pradesh went through various changes in size and administrative form. It became a substate under the Indian constitution of 1950. In 1954 it joined with Bilaspur<br> (a former Indian state and then a chief commissioner’s province), and in 1956 it became a union territory. Himachal Pradesh was enlarged in 1966 by the merger and absorption of numerous <br>Punjab hill areas, including the regions surrounding Shimla, Kangra, and Kullu; the district of Lahaul and Spiti; and parts of the districts centred at Ambala, Hoshiarpur, and Gurdaspur. <br>Early in 1971, Himachal Pradesh became the 18th state of India; Y.S. Parmar, who since the 1940s had been a leader in the quest for self-government in Himachal Pradesh,<br> became the state’s first chief minister.

<h2>  Hampi</h2>
<div id="p3">
    Hampi, a temple town in northern Karnataka, was once the capital of the historical Vijayanagara Dynasty. This quaint place, lying amidst striking ruins of the past, has been receiving tourists<br> from far off for ages. The magnificence of the ruins of temples and other structures of Vijayanagar, dating back to 1500 AD, is the main attraction of this place. According to some accounts,<br> Hampi used to be the second largest city of the world.
    Hampi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, owing to the ancient temples, forts and other monuments here. Hampi was the capital of the<br> Vijayanagar Empire around 1500 AD, and by some accounts, the second largest city in the world at that time. Over the next centuries it fell out of importance, and now there lie ruins of a lot<br> of temples and other structures spread out over a vast area. The terrain around Hampi is as mysterious as the ruins itself - the city is surrounded by boulders of different sizes, and you can climb<br> to the top of them with a little effort to get a stunning view of the entire city and the geography. It is located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. Famous for its massive, beautifully carved<br> temples, Hampi tells the stories of its existing structures. Many a visitor climb atop the Matangaparvata and get a glimpse of Hampi and its environs. The way the city was built with temples<br> and bazaars is exemplary in itself. On the North banks of the river Tungabhadra is the first capital of the Vijayanagar Empire, Anegundi, the temples and stories abound, which will help one<br> to get a better understanding of the local heritage.

<h2> Jaisalmer Fort</h2>
<div id="p4">
    Jaisalmer Fort is situated in the city of Jaisalmer, in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is believed to be one of the very few "living forts" in the world (such as Carcassonne, France), as nearly<br> one fourth of the old city's population still resides within the fort. For the better part of its 800-year history, the fort was the city of Jaisalmer. The first settlements outside the fort walls, to<br> accommodate the growing population of Jaisalmer, are said to have come up in the 17th century.

    Jaisalmer Fort is the second oldest fort in Rajasthan, built in 1156 AD by the Rajput Rawal<br> (ruler) Jaisal from whom it derives its name, and stood at the crossroads of important trade routes (including the ancient Silk road).
    
    The fort's massive yellow sandstone walls are a tawny<br> lion colour during the day, fading to honey-gold as the sun sets, thereby camouflaging the fort in the yellow desert. For this reason it is also known as the Sonar Quila or Golden Fort.<br>The fort stands amidst the sandy expanse of the great Thar Desert on Trikuta Hill. It is today located along the southern edge of the city that bears its name; its dominant hilltop location<br> making the sprawling towers of its fortifications visible for many miles around.
